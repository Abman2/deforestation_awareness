          Between <b>2010 and 2025</b>, the world experienced <b>an average net forest loss of 4.7 million hectares per year</b>. This
          figure accounts for both deforestation and forest regrowth, offering a more balanced view of global forest change.
          However, the rate of deforestation alone was significantly higher, with an estimated <b>10 million hectares of forest
          cleared annually</b>, mostly in tropical regions.
          <br /><br />
          In <b>2024 the planet saw a sharp spike in forest destruction, losing 6.7 million hectares of primary rainforest</b>,
          <b>largely due to wildfires</b>. These fires released an estimated 3.1 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide, surpassing the annual
          fossil fuel emissions of India. Such events highlight the growing impact of climate change and land-use pressures
          on forest ecosystems.

          Regionally, <b>Africa recorded the highest net forest loss, averaging 3.9 million hectares per year</b>, followed by <b> South
          America with 2.6 million hectares annually</b>. On a more hopeful note, countries like Indonesia and Malaysia showed
          signs of improvement in 2024, with reduced rates of primary forest loss compared to previous years.
          <br /><br />
          Despite ongoing challenges, some nations are making progress through reforestation and sustainable land management.
          Yet, the overall trend remains concerning: forest gains are not keeping pace with deforestation. Continued
          monitoring and global cooperation are essential to reverse this trajectory and protect the planetâ€™s remaining
          forests.
